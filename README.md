# Better Excel Finances

This is a personal project in order to track finances. The idea was based on making a better user expereince than inputting spending data manually into a spreadsheet.

## Net Worth Tracking

Net worth tracking allows users to add different asset/debt accounts and categorize where the money in those accounts is dedicated. For example under a savings account a user could attribute funds to both a sinking fund and a house saving fund.

## Monthly spending tracking

This functionality allows users to upload a csv of a credit card statement and see a visualization of expenses categorized by spending category. (Discover/Capital One)

### Development

This project acts as a playground for me to test cutting edge AI development tools, AI has been leveraged in may different ways throughout this project.

#### Note

This project does not accept banking credentials. Users are not able to attach a bank account. Everything must be entered manually.
